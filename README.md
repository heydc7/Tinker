# Tinker
Tinker is a Python tool designed to generate multiple deviation payloads of the same input by using parameter tampering. In other words, Tinker helps you explore different variations of a string by toggling between lowercase and uppercase letters.

# Usage
```bash
>> python3 main.py
>> Enter your string: <INPUT>
```
You'll be prompted to enter your string. For demonstration purposes, you can use "reset-password" as an example.

```bash
>> Output
reset-password
Reset-Password
reset-Password
Reset-password
RESET-PASSWORD
Reset-passworD
reSet-passwOrd
resEt-passwoRd
rEset-pasSword
reSet-paSSword
rEsEt-pAssword
rEsEt-pAsswOrd
```
